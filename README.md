üéµ Music Player App

A simple and intuitive music player app built using Android that allows users to play their saved audio files. The app requests user permission to access all saved audio on the device and provides a seamless music experience.

üìã Features
üé∂ Browse and Play Music: Automatically detects and lists all audio files on the device.
üîç Search Audio Files: Find your favorite tracks easily.
‚èØÔ∏è Basic Controls: Play, pause, next, and previous.
üìÅ Folder Support: Displays music files by folders for easy access.
üé® User-Friendly UI: Minimalistic and responsive design.
üì± Permissions
The app requires the following permissions to function properly:->

READ_MEDIA_AUDIO (For Android 13+): To access and list audio files.
READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE (For Android 12 and below): To access audio files stored on the device.
üöÄ How It Works
Upon launching the app, the user will be prompted to grant the necessary permissions.
Once permissions are granted:
The app scans the device for all saved audio files.
It organizes and lists them in a user-friendly interface.
The user can browse, select, and play any audio file from the list.
